High school students from all the Brazil could apply to participate. Among all the students, 30 were selected to spend 1 week at the São Carlos Physics Institute (IFSC), knowing the laboratories and having lectures about research subjects of the institute. During the three final days, the students participate in a competition where they are divided in 10 teams and each one must reproduce one famous physics experiment and present the results in a seminar in the final day. My group reproduced the electrons diffraction experiment and got the third place.",
